# Integration : Gymnasium (gym)

https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium

 
Gymnasium is an open source Python library for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms by providing
a standard API to communicate between learning algorithms and environments, as well as a standard set of environments 
compliant with that API.
This is a fork of OpenAI's Gym library by it's maintainers 
(OpenAI handed over maintenance a few years ago to an outside team),
and is where future maintenance will occur going forward.
